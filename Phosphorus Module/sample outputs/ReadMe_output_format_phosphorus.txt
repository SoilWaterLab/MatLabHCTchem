Format of Output Text Files

Daily text files
Note: we assume 3 ofes here and each row represents a simulation day
colm 1-3: phosphorus left in the top layer for ofe 1 to 3 (kg/m^2)
colm 4-6: phosphorus left in the bottom layer for ofe 1 to 3 (kg/m^2)
colm 7-9: total phosphorus lost in overland flow for ofe 1 to 3 (kg/m^2)
colm 10-12: dissolved phosphorus lost in overland flow for ofe 1 to 3 (kg/m^2)
colm 13-15: adsorbed phosphorus lost in overland flow for ofe 1 to 3 (kg/m^2)
colm 16-18: phosphorus lost in lateral flow for ofe 1 through 3 (kg/m^2)
colm 19-21: phosphorus lost in shallow percolation for ofe 1 to 3 (from top layer into bottom layer) 
(kg/m^2)
colm 22-24: phosphorus lost in deep percolation for ofe 1 to 3 (kg/m^2)
colm 25: (buffer runs only) particulate phosphorus trapped by buffer (kg/m^2)

Monthly text files (average for all simulations at hillslope base)
colm1: month
colm2: adsorbed phosphorus lost in overland flow (kg/ha)
colm3: dissolved phosphorus lost in overland flow (kg/ha)
colm4: phosphorus lost in lateral flow (kg/ha)
colm5: phosphorus lost in deep percolation (kg/ha)

Yearly text files (average for all simulations at hillslope base)
row1: adsorbed phosphorus lost in overland flow (kg/ha)
row2: dissolved phosphorus lost in overland flow (kg/ha)
row3: phosphorus lost in lateral flow (kg/ha)
row4: phosphorus lost in deep percolation (kg/ha)
