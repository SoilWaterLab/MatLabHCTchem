Format of Output Text Files

Daily loss text files 
Note: we assume 3 ofes here, columns depend on the number of ofes
colm 1-3: no3 lost in overland flow (no sed) (kg/m^2)
colm 4-6: no3 lost in lateral flow (no sed) (kg/m^2)
colm 7-9: no3 lost in perc (no sed) (kg/m^2)
colm 10-12: no3 lost to the the atmosphere (denitrification) (kg/m^2)
colm 13-15: active orgN lost in overland flow (w/sed) (kg/m^2)
colm 16-18: fresh orgN lost in overland flow (w/sed) (kg/m^2)
colm 19-21: stable orgN lost in overland flow (w/sed) (kg/m^2)
colm 22-24: total inorganic N lost (sum of col1 to col5) (kg/m^2)
colm 25-27: total organic N lost (sum of col6 to col9) (kg/m^2)
colm 28: (buffer runs only) particulate N trapped by buffer (kg/m^2)

Daily pools text files
