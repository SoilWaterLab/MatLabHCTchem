Format of Output Text Files

Daily text files
Note: we assume 3 ofes here and each row represents a simulation day
colm 1-3: pesticide left in the top layer for ofe 1 to 3 (kg/m^2)
colm 4-6: pesticide left in the bottom layer for ofe 1 to 3 (kg/m^2)
colm 7-9: total pesticide lost in overland flow for ofe 1 to 3 (kg/m^2)
colm 10-12: dissolved pesticide lost in overland flow for ofe 1 to 3 (kg/m^2)
colm 13-15: adsorbed pesticide lost in overland flow for ofe 1 to 3 (kg/m^2)
colm 16-18: pesticide lost in lateral flow for ofe 1 through 3 (kg/m^2)
colm 19-21: pesticide lost in shallow percolation for ofe 1 to 3 (from top layer into bottom layer) 
(kg/m^2)
colm 22-24: pesticide lost in deep percolation for ofe 1 to 3 (kg/m^2)
colm 25: (buffer runs only) particulate pesticide trapped by buffer (kg/m^2)

Monthly text files (average for all simulations at hillslope base)
colm1: month
colm2: adsorbed pesticide lost in overland flow (kg/ha)
colm3: dissolved pesticide lost in overland flow (kg/ha)
colm4: pesticide lost in lateral flow (kg/ha)
colm5: pesticide lost in deep percolation (kg/ha)

Yearly text files (average for all simulations at hillslope base)
row1: adsorbed pesticide lost in overland flow (kg/ha)
row2: dissolved pesticide lost in overland flow (kg/ha)
row3: pesticide lost in lateral flow (kg/ha)
row4: pesticide lost in deep percolation (kg/ha)
